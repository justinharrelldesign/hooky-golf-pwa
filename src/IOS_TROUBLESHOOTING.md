## üö® STILL SEEING URL BAR? Read This First

If you've followed all installation steps and **STILL see the Safari URL bar**, here's what to check:

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before you panic, verify these basics:

### 1. Are you actually launching from the HOME SCREEN?
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Opening Safari and typing the URL
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Using a Safari bookmark
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Tapping a link from another app
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Tapping the app icon on your iPhone home screen

### 2. Did you FULLY delete the old app?
- Not just removing from home screen
- Must tap "Delete App" to clear all cached data
- iOS caches the manifest - this is the #1 issue

### 3. Are you using SAFARI to install?
- Chrome on iOS **CANNOT** install PWAs
- Firefox on iOS **CANNOT** install PWAs
- Only Safari can install PWAs on iOS

## üß™ Use the PWA Test Page

We've created a diagnostic page to check your installation:

1. **In Safari**, navigate to: `https://YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE.netlify.app/pwa-test.html`
2. **Add it to home screen**
3. **Launch from home screen**
4. Check the results:

### Expected Results (Standalone Mode Working):
```
‚úì Standalone Mode: RUNNING IN STANDALONE
‚úì Display Mode: standalone
‚úì Navigator Standalone: YES
‚úì Apple PWA Meta Tags: capable=yes, status-bar=black-translucent
```

### If You See Browser Mode:
```
‚úó Standalone Mode: BROWSER MODE
‚úó Display Mode: browser
‚úó Navigator Standalone: NO or UNDEFINED
```

This means you're NOT in standalone mode. Continue troubleshooting below.

2. Go to home screen
3. Tap the Hooky Golf icon (NOT Safari)
4. Banner should disappear

### Issue 3: Works in Simulator, Not on Real Device

**This is common and frustrating:**

- **iOS Simulator** often shows standalone mode even when real device doesn't
- **Always test on real hardware**
- Simulator is not reliable for PWA testing

**Solution:**
- Focus on real device testing only
- Don't trust simulator results

---

### Issue 4: Worked Once, Then Broke

**Possible causes:**
1. **App updated** ‚Üí Must reinstall to get new manifest
2. **iOS updated** ‚Üí Some iOS updates break PWAs
3. **Certificate changed** ‚Üí HTTPS issues
4. **Redirected to different URL** ‚Üí Breaks standalone scope

**Solution:**
1. Delete app
2. Clear Safari cache
3. Reinstall fresh
4. Check certificate is valid (lock icon in Safari)

---

### Issue 5: Inconsistent Behavior

**Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't:**

This usually means:
- **Cache issues** between old and new versions
- **Multiple apps installed** from different URLs
- **Offline cache** serving old manifest

**Solution:**
```bash
1. Delete ALL instances of app from home screen
2. Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Website Data
3. Search for your domain
4. Delete ALL entries
5. Hard refresh: Safari ‚Üí Visit site ‚Üí Hold refresh button
6. Reinstall clean
```

## üéØ The Definitive Test

**If you want to be 100% sure standalone mode is working:**

### Test A: Visual Check
Launch the app and look for:
- ‚úÖ No address bar at top
- ‚úÖ No navigation buttons (back/forward)
- ‚úÖ No tab bar at bottom
- ‚úÖ No "Done" button
- ‚úÖ Status bar shows ONLY time/battery/signal
- ‚úÖ App fills entire screen

### Test B: JavaScript Check
Open the test page and check:
```javascript
window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches === true
// AND
window.navigator.standalone === true
```

### Test C: Screenshot Test
Take a screenshot:
- Standalone mode: Screenshot has NO browser UI
- Browser mode: Screenshot shows Safari controls

## üì± iOS Version-Specific Issues

### iOS 17+
- **Best PWA support**
- Should work perfectly with our config
- If not working, likely installation issue

### iOS 16
- **Good PWA support**
- `black-translucent` works well
- May need cache clear + reinstall

### iOS 15
- **Decent PWA support**
- Sometimes requires multiple reinstalls
- Try restarting device between attempts

### iOS 14 and below
- **Limited PWA support**
- May not fully support `display-mode: standalone`
- Consider upgrading iOS if possible

---

## üî¨ Advanced Debugging

### Enable Web Inspector

1. **On iPhone:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced
   - Enable "Web Inspector"

2. **On Mac:**
   - Connect iPhone via USB
   - Open Safari on Mac
   - Develop menu ‚Üí [Your iPhone] ‚Üí [Your Site]

3. **Check Console for:**
   - Service Worker registration errors
   - Manifest parsing errors
   - Network errors loading resources

### Common Console Errors:

```
‚ùå "Manifest: Line 1, column 1, Unexpected token"
‚Üí Manifest JSON is malformed

‚ùå "Service worker registration failed"
‚Üí HTTPS not configured properly

‚ùå "Manifest start_url not in scope"
‚Üí start_url doesn't match scope

‚ùå "Icons must be at least 192x192"
‚Üí Icon files missing or wrong size
```

## üõë When to Give Up on iOS PWA

Unfortunately, iOS PWA support has some known limitations:

### iOS Won't Support:
- ‚ùå Push notifications
- ‚ùå Background sync
- ‚ùå Advanced service worker features
- ‚ùå Some Web APIs that Android supports

### When Browser Mode is Actually OK:
- If you need features iOS PWAs don't support
- If users primarily use on desktop
- If the URL bar doesn't bother users

### Consider Native App If:
- Need push notifications (critical feature)
- Need background processing
- Need advanced device features
- Have budget for native development

## ‚ú® Confirmation of Success

**You've succeeded when:**

1. ‚úÖ App launches from home screen with NO URL bar
2. ‚úÖ Orange warning banner does NOT appear
3. ‚úÖ PWA test page shows "RUNNING IN STANDALONE"
4. ‚úÖ Screenshots show no browser UI
5. ‚úÖ App behaves exactly like a native app
6. ‚úÖ Navigation stays within the app
7. ‚úÖ Status bar is translucent over app content
8. ‚úÖ Safe area insets work (notch spacing)

## üìû Still Stuck?

If you've tried EVERYTHING and it's still not working:

### Double-Check Your Code:

1. **manifest.json** at `/public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "display": "standalone",
  "display_override": ["standalone", "fullscreen"],
  "id": "/?source=pwa"
}
```

2. **index.html** meta tags:
```html
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent" />
```

3. **Service worker** registered in `/src/main.tsx`:
```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
```

4. **HTTPS enabled** on Netlify (automatic)

### Check Netlify:

1. Site settings ‚Üí HTTPS ‚Üí Force HTTPS enabled
2. Deploy log shows no errors
3. `manifest.json` accessible at your-site.netlify.app/manifest.json
4. Icons accessible at your-site.netlify.app/icon-192.png

### Environmental Issues:

1. **Corporate network** blocking PWA features?
2. **VPN** interfering with service worker?
3. **Parental controls** on device?
4. **MDM profile** restricting PWA installation?

## üéì Understanding the Technology

### Why `black-translucent` Works:

- `default`: iOS shows URL bar (legacy behavior)
- `black`: Hides URL bar, black status bar
- `black-translucent`: Hides URL bar, translucent status bar ‚úÖ

### Why Reinstall is Required:

- iOS caches manifest on first install
- No way to force refresh without reinstall
- This is an iOS limitation, not our fault

### Why Safari Only:

- Apple restricts PWA installation to Safari
- Chrome/Firefox on iOS are actually Safari WebView
- WebView can't install PWAs to home screen

- [Can I Use - PWA](https://caniuse.com/web-app-manifest)

**Remember**: iOS PWAs are notoriously finicky. If you've followed all steps correctly and it's still not working after 3 attempts, the issue is likely iOS-specific and beyond our control. Consider filing a bug with Apple or waiting for the next iOS update.

Good luck! üçÄ
