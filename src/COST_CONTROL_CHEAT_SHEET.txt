  HOOKY GOLF - COST CONTROL LIMITS
========================================

🎯 PURPOSE: Keep you on Supabase FREE tier indefinitely

📊 LIMITS IMPLEMENTED:
  ✅ 100 rounds per user (oldest auto-deleted)
  ✅ 50 friends per user (enforced on add)
  ✅ 1MB profile photos (auto-compressed)

💰 SUPABASE FREE TIER:
  Database: 500 MB
  Storage: 1 GB
  Bandwidth: 2 GB/month
  Functions: 500K calls/month

📈 YOUR RUNWAY:
  1,000 users = FREE tier ✅
  3,000 users = Maybe need Pro ($25/mo)
  5,000+ users = Definitely need Pro
  
  But at 5,000 users, you've made $21,000
  So $25/month is nothing! 🎉

🔧 TO CHANGE LIMITS:
  Edit: /supabase/functions/server/index.tsx
  
  Lines 7-9:
    const MAX_ROUNDS_PER_USER = 100;
    const MAX_FRIENDS_PER_USER = 50;
    const MAX_PROFILE_PHOTO_SIZE = 1048576;
