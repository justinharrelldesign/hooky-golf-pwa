## üé® IMPORTANT: Create Your App Icons

You need to create actual app icons to replace the placeholders:

### Required Icons
1. **icon-192.png** (192x192px) - For Android home screen
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512px) - For splash screens and app stores

### Design Recommendations
- Use your brand colors: Green (#517b34) and light green (#cee7bd)
- Golf-themed design (golf flag, golf ball, or club)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Make sure it looks good on both light and dark backgrounds

### Tools to Create Icons
- [Figma](https://figma.com) - Design your icon
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) - Generate all sizes
- [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) - PWA icon generator
- [Canva](https://canva.com) - Quick icon design

### How to Add Icons
1. Create/export your icons as PNG files (192x192 and 512x512)
2. Replace `/public/icon-192.png` and `/public/icon-512.png`
3. Optionally, create additional sizes for better iOS support

npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
```bash
# Add to package.json scripts:
"deploy": "npm run build && npx gh-pages -d dist"

# Then run:
npm run deploy
```

## üìä PWA Checklist

Before launching, verify your PWA with these tools:

### Lighthouse Audit
1. Open your deployed app in Chrome
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
4. Select "Progressive Web App" category
5. Click "Analyze page load"
6. Aim for 90+ score

### PWA Testing Tools

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Updating
```javascript
// Force update by incrementing cache version in sw.js
const CACHE_NAME = 'hooky-golf-v2'; // Increment v1 ‚Üí v2
```

### Install Prompt Not Showing
- Must be served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- User must visit site at least once
- Chrome requires 30-second engagement before showing prompt
- Some browsers (Safari) don't support custom install prompts

### App Not Working Offline
- Check that service worker is registered (DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers)
- Verify important assets are cached in sw.js
- Test by going offline in DevTools (Network tab ‚Üí Offline checkbox)

## üéâ What Users Will Experience

1. **First Visit**: User sees your web app with optional install prompt
2. **Installation**: User clicks install ‚Üí app added to home screen
3. **App Launch**: Opens in standalone mode (no browser chrome)

## üì± Next Steps for Native App Stores

If you want to publish to iOS App Store or Google Play Store:

### Option 1: Capacitor (Recommended)
Wrap your PWA as a native app:

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init
npx cap add ios
npx cap add android
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios
npx cap open android
```

### Option 2: PWA Builder
1. Go to [PWABuilder.com](https://www.pwabuilder.com/)
2. Enter your deployed PWA URL
3. Download app packages for iOS and Android
4. Submit to app stores

## üîí Important Notes

- **HTTPS Required**: PWAs require HTTPS (except localhost for testing)
