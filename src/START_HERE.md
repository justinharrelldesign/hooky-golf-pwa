## ❓ Common Questions

### "Is my app actually ready?"
**YES!** Everything is configured and ready to go. You just need to deploy it.

### "Will it cost money?"
**NO!** Netlify and Supabase free tiers are generous enough for small to medium apps.

### "Do I need to create app icons?"
**Not immediately!** The app works without them. You can add proper icons later.

### "How long will it take?"
**10-15 minutes** if you follow the guide. Most of that is waiting for builds.

### "What if something breaks?"
Every guide includes troubleshooting sections. Plus, Netlify lets you rollback instantly.

### "Can I update the app after launch?"
**YES!** Just push to GitHub and Netlify auto-deploys. Users get updates automatically.
