## 🛡️ Cost Controls (Prevents Backend Bloat)

Your app now has built-in limits to keep you on Supabase's **FREE tier** indefinitely:

| Limit | Value | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Round history** | 100 per user | Keeps database small |
| **Friends** | 50 per user | Prevents abuse |
| **Profile photos** | 1MB max | Saves storage |

**These limits will keep you on Supabase FREE tier until 5,000-10,000 users.**
