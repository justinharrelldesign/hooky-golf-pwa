3. User taps the price button
4. **Apple/Google's native payment sheet appears**
5. User confirms with Face ID/Touch ID/Password
6. Payment processes through their iTunes/Google account
7. App downloads and installs
8. User opens app - everything is unlocked

**You never see their payment info. You never handle money directly.**

## üéØ Maximizing Paid App Downloads

### 1. **App Store Optimization (ASO)**

- **Title:** "Hooky Golf - Office Boss Escape"
- **Subtitle:** "Sneak past coworkers for golf freedom"
- **Keywords:** golf, game, office, humor, satire, casual, multiplayer
- **Description:** Lead with unique concept, show screenshots

### 2. **Screenshot Strategy**

Show value immediately:
1. Boss encounter (most unique feature)
2. Friend multiplayer 
3. Ranking system
4. "18 hilarious bosses" callout

### 3. **App Preview Video** (30 seconds)

- 0-5s: Hook ("Ever wanted to skip work for golf?")
- 5-15s: Show boss encounter gameplay
- 15-25s: Show multiplayer with friends
- 25-30s: "18 bosses, unlimited rounds, $4.99"

### 4. **Social Proof**

- Get 10-20 beta testers to leave 5-star reviews at launch
- Share to Reddit: /r/golf, /r/iosgaming
- Post on Twitter/LinkedIn with funny boss descriptions
- Create TikTok showing one boss encounter

### 5. **Pricing Psychology**

$4.99 is the sweet spot:
- ‚úÖ Feels premium (not cheap)
- ‚úÖ Low enough to impulse buy
- ‚úÖ Standard tier (many apps use it)
- ‚ùå Avoid $0.99 (looks cheap)
- ‚ùå Avoid $9.99+ (too high for first-time buyers)

## üÜö Paid vs Freemium: Why You Chose Right

### Your App is Perfect for Paid Model Because:

1. **Concept Sells Itself** - "Golf + office satire" is clear value
2. **No Consumables** - Nothing to sell repeatedly (rounds aren't consumed)
3. **Social Features** - Players want friends to have full version too
4. **High Polish** - Custom boss illustrations justify premium price
5. **No Ads Needed** - Content is the product, not attention

### When Freemium Would Be Better:

- ‚ùå If you had 100+ bosses (could sell boss packs)
- ‚ùå If rounds consumed "energy" (could sell energy refills)
- ‚ùå If game required network effects (need critical mass of players)
- ‚ùå If brand building was priority (need max downloads)

---

## üîÑ If You Want to Switch to Freemium Later

**Can you change a paid app to free?**  
YES, but you can't go back to paid after.

**Process:**
1. Update price to $0 in App Store Connect
2. Implement IAP for "Premium Unlock - $4.99"
3. Show ads in free version (optional)
4. Existing paid users automatically get premium (check receipt)

**When to consider this:**
- After 6-12 months if downloads < 1,000
- If you add enough content for DLC model
- If competitors go free and steal market share
