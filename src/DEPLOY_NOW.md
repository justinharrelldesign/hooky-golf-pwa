## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### Build fails on Netlify
**Solution:** 
1. Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Try building locally first: `npm run build`

### App doesn't load after deployment
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify environment variables are set in Netlify
3. Make sure Supabase is accessible (not localhost)

### Install prompt doesn't show
**Solution:**
- Must be on HTTPS (Netlify provides this automatically)
- Some browsers don't support install prompts
- On iPhone, users must manually "Add to Home Screen"

### Service Worker not updating
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Close and reopen the app completely
3. In Chrome DevTools: Application → Service Workers → Unregister

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deploying, track these to measure success:

- ✅ Number of signups
- ✅ Number of rounds played
- ✅ Friend requests sent/accepted
- ✅ Average session duration
- ✅ User retention (do they come back?)

Check these in Supabase Dashboard → Database → `kv_store_15cc1085` table.

## 💰 Costs

### Current Setup (PWA):
- **Netlify:** FREE for up to 100GB bandwidth/month
- **Supabase:** FREE for up to 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth/month
